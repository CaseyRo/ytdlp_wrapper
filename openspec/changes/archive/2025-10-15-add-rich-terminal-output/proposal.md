# Add Rich Terminal Output

## Why
The current terminal output is plain text with minimal formatting, making it difficult to track download progress, understand what's happening, and quickly identify issues. Adding Rich library support will provide beautiful, informative terminal output with progress bars, color-coded status messages, and structured information display, significantly improving user experience and clarity.

## What Changes
- Add `rich` library as a dependency in pyproject.toml
- Implement Rich console output for all user-facing messages
- Add progress bars for download operations
- Use color-coded status indicators (green for success, yellow for warnings, red for errors)
- Create formatted panels for important information (configuration summary, completed downloads)
- Add rich tables for displaying video lists and statistics
- Maintain backward compatibility with simple text output (optional fallback)
- Update documentation with screenshots/examples of new output

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: terminal-ui (new capability)
- **Affected code**: download.py (replace print statements with Rich console output)
- **User benefit**: Dramatically improved visual feedback and progress tracking
- **Breaking changes**: None (output format changes but functionality remains the same)
- **Dependencies**: Adds `rich>=13.0.0` to pyproject.toml
