# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Dependency Configuration
- [x] 1.1 Create pyproject.toml with project metadata
- [x] 1.2 Define dependencies (yt-dlp and python-dotenv)
- [x] 1.3 Set Python version requirement (>=3.7)
- [x] 1.4 Add optional dependencies group if needed

## 2. Documentation
- [x] 2.1 Reorganize README to feature UV as primary installation method
- [x] 2.2 Simplify prerequisites section (UV + ffmpeg only, not individual Python packages)
- [x] 2.3 Create prominent UV quick-start section at top of Installation
- [x] 2.4 Document UV commands (uv sync, uv run)
- [x] 2.5 Move pip installation to "Alternative Installation Methods" section
- [x] 2.6 Update usage examples to show UV run commands first
- [x] 2.7 Simplify overall README flow to reduce complexity

## 3. Quality Assurance
- [x] 3.1 Test pyproject.toml with UV installation
- [x] 3.2 Verify all dependencies install correctly via UV
- [x] 3.3 Test that script runs after UV setup
- [x] 3.4 Ensure backward compatibility with pip still works
