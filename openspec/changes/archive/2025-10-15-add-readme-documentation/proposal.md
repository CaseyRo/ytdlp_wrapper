# Add README Documentation

## Why
The project currently lacks user-facing documentation. Users need clear instructions on installation, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting to effectively use the YouTube Watch Later downloader. Without a README, the tool's capabilities and setup requirements are not immediately apparent.

## What Changes
- Create comprehensive README.md in project root
- Document installation steps (Python, yt-dlp, ffmpeg)
- Explain configuration options (environment variables)
- Provide usage examples and common workflows
- Include troubleshooting section for common issues
- Add cookie setup instructions for Watch Later playlist access
- Add privacy policy and legal usage disclaimer section
- Document terms of service compliance and responsible use guidelines

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: user-documentation (new capability)
- **Affected code**: No code changes, documentation only
- **User benefit**: Significantly improved onboarding and usability
- **Breaking changes**: None
